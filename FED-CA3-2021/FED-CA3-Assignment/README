Additional Features - I have used!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)-> When you scroll, you will see the Nab bar, turning from transparent to black!

2)-> For the Index page, A secure and private access,Protect all your devices etc, actually is using a layered background
     in order for its effect. I initially tried using a picture beside it to do it, however, due to my inexperience at that point
     of time(during the 1 week holiday), I figured out it be better to do it! Furthermore, these background also does not clutter
     the user screen, making it clean and effecient! Its a win win - sleak and effecient

3)-> For Pricing, i used the feature of bootstrap which is card to implement the feature! Very sleak and fast!

4)-> Some of the Headers will also float(intuitive just from looking at it~)

5)-> When hovering over the servers "See all servers button" you will see it glow which is a very cool effect!

6)-> In "Our server" the country flags and And other countries are actually using tables -> though insignifcant but just wanted to point out!

7)-> In contact, if you were looking from a viewport less than 990 in width, the calendar will disappear(too large), however for PC users,
     due to the large viewport, we implemented a calendar so users can know when to should contact/know when
     is the best time to contact thew hotline!

8)-> For the footer, I used FontAwesome CDN, so as to give cool logos such as ones from Facebook, twitter, google+, linkedin, and lastly instagram!

9)-> At the popular support topic of 5.customerserivce.html, everything can break, so an a phone can fit 1 at a time, while an ipad can fit 2, while a pc can fit 
     3 columns at a time!
